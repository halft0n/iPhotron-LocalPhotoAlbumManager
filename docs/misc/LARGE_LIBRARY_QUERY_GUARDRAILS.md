# Large Library Query Guardrails

This note protects the large-library browsing path. Touch this area carefully:
small convenience fallbacks can reintroduce full-library work.

## Contract

- Normal Gallery reads should stay SQL-first through `CollectionQuery` /
  `WindowResult` when the query can be represented in the repository.
- All Photos, album, favorites, videos, map/GPS, media type, and date range
  views must not fall back to `read_all()` plus Python filtering/sorting.
- `GalleryCollectionStore.asset_at()` is cache-only. Do not make it
  synchronously fetch arbitrary rows.
- `row_for_path()` and live partner lookup must use repository/query-service
  lookup helpers, not full model scans.
- Snapshot/change detection must use count, window range, and collection
  revision. Do not restore full-row snapshot hashing.
- Visible collection queries default to ready-only rows with non-empty
  `thumb_cache_key`.
- Stale thumbnail repair must be visible-window/backfill oriented. Do not run a
  full-library synchronous repair during startup or collection open.
- Keep ready-query `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` tests using visible/gps indexes and no
  temp sort for hot views.
